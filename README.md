#Seedtable Links Fix
Script to fix broken links of startups on Seedtable

Many links to the websites of startups are broken.
They are broken due to additional `http` string being added before the link.
This script finds all such broken links and lists them in the 
`broken-links.txt` file. The file is updated as of latest commit.
